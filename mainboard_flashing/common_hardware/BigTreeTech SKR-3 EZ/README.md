# 120 ohm Termination Resistor

There is *meant* to be a  permanent 120 ohm termination resistor soldered to the board, no need to add a jumper to enable it and also no ability to disable it. 

However, it seems some recent boards have been made without this resitor and instead including a standalone resitor with the connector packet which you can crimp on if required.
