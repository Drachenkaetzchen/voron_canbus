# USB/CAN Mode Switch

For normal operations connected to your CAN network, make sure the USB/CAN switch is set to CAN.

If you need to flash the Eddy over USB in BOOT mode (for the intial flashing of Katapult or to recover
from a bad firmware flash) set the USB/CAN switch to USB.

Just remember to change it *back* to the CAN option before reconnecting it to your CAN network.

# RP Boot Mode

Make sure the USB/CAN switch is in the USB position then hold the BOOT button while plugging the USB cable into your Pi.

The BOOT button is located on the top of the Eddy.

Change the USB/CAN switch back to the CAN position once you are finished using the USB/BOOT mode.
